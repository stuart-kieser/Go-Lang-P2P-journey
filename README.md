# Go Lang P2P journey
 Here is a study guide that you can use to turn yourself from a Go Lang beginner to a senior P2P blockchain developer in 6 months, assuming that you will do an hour of learning every day.  Month 1: Learn the Basics of Go Lang  Install Go Lang and set up your development environment. Learn the basics of Go programming language, including syntax, data types, variables, and control structures. Get familiar with the standard library, and learn how to use packages and modules. Write some simple Go programs to practice what you've learned. Month 2: Study Data Structures and Algorithms  Study data structures and algorithms, and how to implement them in Go. Learn how to write efficient and optimized code, and how to analyze and improve performance. Implement basic data structures and algorithms in Go, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting algorithms. Month 3: Explore Distributed Systems  Study the basics of distributed systems, including concepts such as nodes, communication, synchronization, and consensus. Learn how to use Go to build distributed systems, such as client-server applications and peer-to-peer networks. Explore different networking protocols, such as TCP, UDP, and HTTP, and learn how to use them in your Go programs. Month 4: Understand Blockchain Technology  Study the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including cryptography, distributed ledger, and smart contracts. Learn about the different types of blockchains, such as public, private, and permissioned, and their use cases. Study the Ethereum platform and Solidity language, and learn how to write smart contracts. Month 5: Build Your First Blockchain Application  Use Go to build a basic blockchain application, such as a simple cryptocurrency. Implement features such as transactions, wallets, mining, and consensus. Deploy your application on a testnet, and test its functionality. Month 6: Build Advanced Blockchain Applications  Use Go to build more advanced blockchain applications, such as decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, or DAOs. Implement more complex smart contracts, and use tools such as Truffle or Remix to test and deploy them. Explore different consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Stake or Delegated Proof of Stake, and understand their pros and cons.
